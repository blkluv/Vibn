Once I started to think, what benefited me most. One answer sprung up in my mind —— that minimalist. We are familiar with the rapid change 
that the modern society bought us. But that is awful. I thought we just need a place to calm down, and start a new journey, refresh one's mind
relieve some thoughts. That's enough.

Look at this cute "dog head", I use it frequently, just to show my expression. Frequently used things can make people focus less on their design.
For example, is any body has noticed the never-changing home page of [CNN.com](https://cnn.com), or anyone got the newest website design update of [Apple.com](https://apple.com)?

In consequence, frequently-changed design can not make users feel better, for they frequently use these websites to do something repeatable.
They concentrated on the content instead of design.

That what I want to do: build a content-friendly website instead of adding useless animations and ads. That the true good userinterface.
Avoid troubles, fast & relieable.

It was [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org) which was my favorite framework that provides a static-generate tool that I could easily wrote my blog posts
in Mdx and push them to [my GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Cloudflare233/www) easily. Then [Vercel](https://vercel.com) can fetch them and deploy it
globally.They are really good work partner.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) also made my website style so easily, but thinking of the size of the package. I might remove it from my project
some day!

Along with Crimson Pro and Work Sans as font to make the userinterface better. [All the highlight are free to be found here](https://github.com/Cloudflare233/www)!
