### Past

The first time when I met [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is that it was named as **Zeit**. Dated back to that time when I was still in junior high,
I just use the platform to deploy my hexo blog. I just be awazed by the rapid speed it deployed and its [amazing website design](https://vercel.com/design).

It was when I started to get familiar with [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org) after when I fell in love with this React Framework.
I used it to [build my personal website](https://github.com/Cloudflare233/www) (you are now browsering it!).


I know that Vercel has won a financing of $200000, which is a huge sum of money for emerging network companies. I believe that Vercel has invested this money in appropriate places to enhance the developer experience.

### Now

I'm still putting my websites on Vercel.And I also managed my domain name on Vercel, which is indeed a good platform. My website runs very well there. As is well known, Vercel provides an excellent Serverless platform, which I have used to establish a blog comment system and a reading statistics (while also using Firebase). I may restart these two projects.

Everything is running well now, and I am not considering transferring to Netlify yet.

>As I concerned, Vercel might be banned by PRC government for unknown reason(

### Future

With the stability of App Route, I may move to this new directory. This is a groundbreaking progress for both Vercel and Next.Js. React!

The conclusion is obvious, Vercel is a great internet company. Personally, I think what I can expect is faster webpage loading speed, better user experience, and also higher traffic. I hope that everything will come true in the near future. I hope the future of the internet is getting better and brighter!
