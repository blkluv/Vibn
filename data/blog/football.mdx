Before playing Portugal, Morocco's manager Walid Regragui said they had the backing of an entire African continent. The team responded to that support by becoming the first African team to reach the FIFA World Cup semifinals.

Though Morocco will face the reigning champions France later, there is no reason to stop believing in themselves because "The Atlas Lions" proved that anything is possible in football.

If there is one connection that is so tight and tragic in football, the relationship between England and penalty shooting must be it. Harry Kane made the first penalty against France to give the "Three Lions" hope, but then wiped it by missing the second shot.

France are now only two wins away from becoming the second team in history to defend the World Cup championship after Brazil did so in 1958 and 1962.
