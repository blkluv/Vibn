Recently, I took up badminton as my new hobby. What's impressed me most is this sport is easy to control. And It is fun to play it. This saturday, while we had a P.E. class unexpectedly for it rained heavily at that point. I played it with my classmate for about 30 minutes.
I was supposed to be tired, but the truth is that I even didn't feel any sense of tire. I was full of energy and when I backed to the library and continued my homework, I can feel I was more energetic ever than before.

This is the positive impact that badminton brought on me. Behind this sport, it is a good way to relax, to escape from the heavy schoolwork and find a little period time to just concentrate on another thing.
My math teacher once said it is good for us to take up a sport to relax, it is good for both mental and body.

This sunday, however, when I went back home. I played badminton with my father for another 40 minutes. Though the wind was heavy, we kept on playing it and we had a great time.
Anyway, I'll keep this hobby, not only to relax, but to improve --- concentration and techniques.
