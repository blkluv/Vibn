**2023 is coming!** I'm happy to say that I've learnt a lot in the passed 2022. At the summer time, I left junior high school and became a new senior high school student of [Yantai No.1 Middle School](http://www.ytyz.net). And that's **exciting**!

I scored **775.5** of **820** in the junior high school graduation exam. But after a long summer vacation from **6.16** to **8.29**, I found it difficult to keep up with the more difficult senior high schoolwork. But as you can see, I **tried all my best** to make it and **succeeded in the end**. Now half year has passed and I was about to finish my first term at senior high. **The future is bright!**

In 2022, I owned **3** domains and found **[germania.ga](https://germania.ga/)**, **[music.cf233.ga](https://music.cf233.ga)** and **[tv.cf233.ga](https://tv.cf233.ga/)**. I even created a e-mail service **donkeymail.gq** but unfortunately it was ended by me after sending and receving 4 mails.

In 2022, **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** published and introduced **[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org)**. And **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss)** crew published **TailwindCSS V3**. With them, I just studied React by myself for I didn't want to treat it serioucly at all. But they are **really good helpers** and I created things with them listed by following:

- [cf233.ga](https://cf233.ga) A modern, beautiful designed by myself, set with Next.js and TailwindCSS. Equiped with good UI/UX and is minmal. Fast & Stable.
- [cf233.eu.org](https://cf233.eu.org) A modern, beautiful designed by myself, set with Next.js and TailwindCSS. Equiped with good UI/UX and is minmal. Fast & Stable. (The same as cf233.ga)
- [music.cf233.ga](https://music.cf233.ga/) A modern but a little ugly music player sourced from **Netease Music**.
- [tv.cf233.ga](https://tv.cf233.ga/) A modern but a little ugly video player sourced from **Onedrive**.

>In the future I might create more works...

Obviously, **tomorrow will be better** and I wish you guys happy new year and god please **bless everyone in the earth**. Furthermore, only by **getting together** can we have a better life.
