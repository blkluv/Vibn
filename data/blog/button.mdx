In this article, I want to share my ideas about designing a button. By reading this article, you'll be able to learn how to:

1. Design buttons with different styles and colors. Including various of usage, like alert or what...
2. Check if your button is modern enough to suit the young.
3. How to design more well-welcomed button through [TailwindCSS](https://TailwindCSS.com)<sup>1</sup>.

So It's get started!

Firstly, we see plenty of buttons online each day. The usage of them is worldwide, for example, while we are shopping online, we can see a big "Check out" on the website to remind us to pay through pressing it.

When the Microsoft Windows 95 was released, the people in the world were surprised to see the "start" button what seems normal today right in the leftbottom of their screen.

That was button was actully borned, let's start from this. If we typed the code below, the browser will respond like this:

> Notice: I gonna use TailwindCSS from now.

```
<button>start</button>
```

<button className="not prose">start</button>

We can add some functions to it, such as this one:

```
<button className="not-prose" onClick={()=>alert('Hi')}>press me</button>
```

<button onClick={() => alert('Hi')}>press me</button>

We can also style it easily with normal CSS, like this:

```
<button class="button">start</button>
```

<br />

```
.button{
   background-color: #000000;
}
```

I recommended [TailwindCSS](https://TailwindCSS.com), it can help you style your website easily without leaving your HTML. For example, I can do this:

```
<button class="bg-black text-white">Check out</button>
```

Then I can adjust its padding and margin to suit my website page. For it can make the button like better.

```
<button class="bg-black text-white px-8 py-2">Check out</button>
```

We can also set the border-radius for a better look:

```
<button class="bg-black text-white px-8 py-2 rounded-lg">Check out</button>
```

Then It's time to set Hover style to the button, just like what [Vercel](https://vercel.com) did.

```
<button class="bg-black text-white px-8 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-white hover:text-black border-black">Check out</button>
```

Even animations, shadows, or what what what..., if you like:

```
<button class="bg-black text-white px-8 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-white hover:text-black border-black shadow-sm transition-all">Check out</button>
```

>You can create colorful buttons at the same time

In conclusion, through the steps we can design a simple button throughout [TailwindCSS](https://TailwindCSS.com), it is not the born of a simple button, but it was a easy solution to the creator of websites --- less time, more confident, better user interface.

But the size of the package is always a problem. So for big-project creators, I don't recommended it well. But for tiny-project such as designing your own personal website, [TailwindCSS](https://TailwindCSS.com) can save a lot of time and energy<sup>2</sup>.
