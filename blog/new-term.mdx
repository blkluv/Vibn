1. The summer vacation is going to be end in less than 1 days (we are
    going to start a new term in Aug 24, 2023.). This is horrible.

2. I've finished most of the work of building {""}<a href="https://music.gengyue.eu.org">The DM Music Company (?)</a>. Thus
    I've registed a domain for it to use seperatedly, I shall be waiting for
    months till it was checked I thought :(

3. I got a new physics teacher. That's exciting!
