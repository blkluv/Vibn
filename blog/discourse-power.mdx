Yesterday(Sep 23, 2023) I listened to a lecture presented by Headmaster Cai Renxiang about education. This turn he mainly discussed the tips to study: to appreciate, to how limited time training, to ask for the teacher's help...
Sounds familiar, his words are really similar to my math teacher's.

Instead serves as a headmaster like Cai, my math teacher Ker(Wang Guijiang, the king of expensive river) is just a *normal* math teacher and Math Olympics Coach of Yantai No.1 Middle School.
Though he had the idea of xxx (you know) like Cai 10 years ago, he *do not* have the **Discourse Power**. Our school's headmaster didn't accept him 10 years ago, but he accepts Cai 10 years later.

What a shame! But this is the truth, what I'll tell you is that this is what the country currently like: Power and Fortune are Everything. The things we care is definitely knowledge and education, but we **only want knowledge to lead to more wealth**, that's dull man!

Anyway, we don't have the Discourse Power, so we can do nothing. **Que Sera Sera, live the life we want, not the others want us to live**.

Love You
