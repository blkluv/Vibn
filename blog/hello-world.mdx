# People Did It

I met a few people online like [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/),[Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/),[Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/) and [Carl Barenburg](https://carlbarenbrug.com/). All these guys write really high-quality articles.
Good articles can give people delighted feeling and inspiration. We can learn something through reading. This can meanwhile improve our ability and work efficiency.

# I Need  It

In the fast-paced world nowadays, I need someplace to slow down and express some of my feelings through the daily study.
I need to summarize and conclude what I've seen, learnt and thought. A blog can help me manage these well. Build a minimal blog
can also help me concentrate on my writing.

# How To Build One

I chose and recommended [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the work.
With the easy provider, I could start a blog in minutes and fetch contents through [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).
To improve the ability to read, I use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) as the main font on the website.
It it really elegant on site!

To summarize, I really have a rosy outlook on this blog, I couldn't help start writing right now!
