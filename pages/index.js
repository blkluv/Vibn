          Why do everyone around me is always in a hurry. Even across China,
          everyone is in a hurry. We rushed out of the door to go to school at
          6:50 a.m. and rushed back home at 9:30 p.m.. Can we stop to slowing
          down, is everyday is just blur? That's the question we really need to
          consider seriously.
